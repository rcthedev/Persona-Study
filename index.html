    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>

    <p>First need to add some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>

    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>

    <p>This is how to make an unordered list:
        <ul> 
            <li>add a "ul" eliment (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>add each item in it's own "li" eliment.</li>
            <li>They dont need to be in any particular order.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This is what and ordered list looks like</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same </li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers incriment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Inline Elements</h4>
    
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a peticular word or phrase</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>Strong</strong>ly empathize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h5>Empty Elements</h5>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now</p>

    <p>Regards,</br>
